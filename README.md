# generate-uuid.js

## About

This is a npm package that can generate a v4 uuid through 1 simple function.

## Installation

```
npm i generate-uuid
```

## Example

After installing the package you can finally write some code!
First you'll have to require the package.

```js
const generateUUID = require("generate-uuid");
```

Then just run the function and it will generate an v4 UUID for you!

```js
generateUUID();
```

Now to demonstrate that it works you can log it.

```js
console.log(generateUUID());
```

Final code will look something like this:

```js
const generateUUID = require("generate-uuid");
console.log(generateUUID());
```

It's as easy as that!
